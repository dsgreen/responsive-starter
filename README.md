Responsive HTML and CSS starter templates

#What is this?
HTML and CSS to use as a starting point for a project. This is largely an experiment and one person's exploration into responsive design. An older, existing HTML codebase was upgraded with best practices and to use a responsive design. Other frameworks were examined (Bootstrap, Foundation, HTML5 Boilerplate, Skeleton), and ideas were borrowed.

Includes a reset section, typography, and a responsive grid. Also includes classes for displaying a grid overlay image on the document.

Column classes accommodate different coding styles. For example, a seven column span could be defined with the class “.seven” (similar to Foundation 3 naming conventions), or “.span-7” (similar to Bootstrap 2 naming conventions), or “.col-7.” Classes are available for ".half," ".one-quarter," ".two-thirds," etc.
